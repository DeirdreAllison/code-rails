# Read this!

To get you in the right mindset, and provide a little bit of context, here's some background material you should spend some time with before proceeding.

1. Read (but don't follow along...yet) our modified copy of the [Rails Getting Started Guide sections 5 through 6](http://assets.codefellows.org/getting_started_rails_modified.html)
  - Not very BDD, is it?
  - Try not to skip over the contents of the table showing files generated.
1. [Read a Code Fellows Alumnus' Blog Post:](http://strandcode.com/2013/07/28/reading-rails-mvc-and-scaffolding-for-rails-newbs)
  - This is a greatly detailed article that lays bare exactly what Rails is doing for you when you use a generator.
  - Don't ya love the intro to this post, that captures the feeling of learning rails?
