# Refactor
- Customize the HTML template
  - If you want to change the `<title>` tag of the page, where would you go?
  - Hints:
    - <span style="color: white">The title tag is something in the page layout, that is set application wide right now.</span>
    - <span style="color: white">Is it M,V, or C?</span>
- Add some basic information about you. Why would someone want to hire you? What you add doesn't have to be styled well, but try to structure it with basic HTML.
