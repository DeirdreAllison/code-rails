# As a Rails developer, I want my code to follow industry-standard best practices so that my projects are readable, scalable, and secure

###Rails conventions:
####Read this article, written by a Code Fellows alumna: http://www.stephaniehekker.com/why-you-should-write-a-readme-for-your-application/
Decide on what you want to use as a standard README format for all your projects

###Code for clarity:
####Read Chpater 1 of the book Clean Code, by Uncle Bob Martin: https://www.dropbox.com/s/y9jxxvlgnbocvn7/Chapter%201%20-%20Clean%20Code%20-%20A%20Handbook%20of%20Agile%20Software%20Craftsmanship.pdf

###Ruby style guide
- Whitespace
    - 2 spaces (not tabs)
    - No whitespace at the end of the line
    - A single newline at the end of every file
- Comments
    - Read:https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#comments (just read up to Classes and Methods)
- Online resources:
    - Read: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide
    - Read and compare: https://github.com/styleguide
- Gem tool:
    - gem install rubocop
    - **DO**: run rubocop from within your project directory for your work from Chapter 1.
    - Extra Credit: figure out how to ignore a warning (like for double-quoted strings, which Brook says is fine)
- Rails Gemfile:
    - Read http://mcdowall.info/posts/gemfile-best-practices-and-discourse/

####Your IDE: A text editor:

- Remap shift-space to underscore: http://gfxmonk.net/2009/01/29/remap-shiftspace-to-underscore.html
- How to set up Sublime Text for our conventions. Choose Sublime Text / Preferences / Settings - User and enter these settings:
        "{
            "ignored_packages":
            [
              "Vintage"
            ],
            "save_on_focus_lost": true,
            "tab_size": 2,
            "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
            "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true,
            "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true
          }"

- Install the package manager for your version of Sublime.
    - Find & install some great recommended packages.
- Get to know your editor:
    - Watch a few of these hints that look interesting to you: https://tutsplus.com/course/improve-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/
    - Recommended: Multi-cursor, Instant file switching.
    - You should know this site exists: http://rails-bestpractices.com (A lot of what's there may not yet make sense. That's ok.)
