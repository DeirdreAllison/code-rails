# Watch This!
Watch and do the following:<br>
http://railscasts.com/episodes/417-foundation?view=asciicast.
######Push your resulting app to Github.

Hints:<br>
This RailsCast is done with Rails 3.2. So you have some options:

Use Rails 3.2.13

    gem install rails -v 3.2.13

    rails _3.2.13_ new [appname]

Ensure you match all the other gem versions.
If you really get stuck, clone the finished app from
GitHub, and just follow along closely with the code.
Use Rails 4.1, and try to figure out what is different
If you get stuck, use this as a reference:
https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-foundation/

If you are using Rails 4 and Foundation 5, things may not work exactly as detailed in the RailsCast. Try this thread if you are having issues with the `@import` command:<br>
https://github.com/zurb/foundation/issues/2128 <br>

(Yikes!) Note in Rails 4, you don't need to put gems in the :asset group: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16406204/why-did-rails4-drop-support-for-assets-group-in-the-gemfile

To use the latest Foundation 5, the gem name is "foundation-rails": http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/upgrading.html

When the RailsCast suggests changing css values, put in your own values to see the change and get something you like.
