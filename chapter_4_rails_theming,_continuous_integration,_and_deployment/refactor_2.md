How can you customize your downloaded theme and make it stand out from the crowd?
At least add some copy unique to who you are and what you want your site to be about (hint: you!)<br>
Option 1: If you have time, do it!<br>
Option 2: If you don't end up with time, enter in some user stories into the Project Management site to remind yourself in the future what you'd like to customize.
