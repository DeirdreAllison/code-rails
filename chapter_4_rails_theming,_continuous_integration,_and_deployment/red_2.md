The RailsCast is essentially building up a custom theme. If you like that approach, and have the css chops already, keep going with it to make your site look the way you want it.
Here's some nice Creative Commons images you can use as background:<br>

Otherwise, choose a theme, here are some collections of Zurb themes. You may also be able to find your own but paying $5-$40 for a professionally designed theme is a good deal and a great time saver.
ONLY USE A THEME THAT MATCHES YOUR FOUNDATION VERSION. Look closely at what version of Foundation it is based on. Do not proceed if you do not have a match with your app.

(look for Zurb 5 templates)

...and whatever you find. Google away, and share your best finds with the class!

Write a spec to verify the theme loads properly. What does your theme do that you can test for? You may need to look into the theme code to find out. Don't be afraid of coming back and re-writing this test once you have the theme loaded.
