Add the theme's files to the appropriate places in the Rails file hierarchy<br>
Read again if needed:<br>
The Rails Asset Pipeline Guide, especially section 2.1: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html

Remember, "assets" are the css, js, image, etc files your site uses.
The theme you selected should simply have html/css/js/images that you need to extract from the theme and add to your Rails app. Copy/paste is ok here!<br>
Some things belong in app/assets and others in vendor/assets - what is the difference?
