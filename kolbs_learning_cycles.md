#####David Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle

David Kolb identified four stages in the adult education process that must all be performed to achieve true understanding:

* Concrete Experience ->
* Reflective Observation ->
* Abstract Conceptualization ->
* Active Experimentation

Each stage is mutually supportive of and feeds into the next. It is possible to enter the cycle at any stage and follow it through around the circle."
