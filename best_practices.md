# Best practices

Rails is a web app framework that is influenced by best practices at its very core.

>"A best practice is a method or technique that has consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other means, and that is used as a benchmark" - [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice)

Rails was originally an abstraction out of a web app, Basecamp. It was designed to take out the "boring parts" of web app creation, and to make new web apps "the right way".
