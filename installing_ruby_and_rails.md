# Installing Ruby and Rails

- Ensure your laptop setup meets the following requirements:
  - Ruby 2.11 at the latest patch level.
    - Ruby should be installed in userspace, not at the system level. If you are using `sudo` to install gems, then "you're doing it wrong".
    - If you're on a Mac, you should use the Homebrew package manager: http://brew.sh. On linux your system will already have a package manager.
  - Rails, latest version 4.1
