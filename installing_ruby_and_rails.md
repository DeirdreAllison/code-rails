# 0.3 Install Ruby and Rails

##Ensure your laptop setup meets the following requirements:
  - Ruby 2.1.2 at the latest patch level.
    - Ruby should be installed in userspace, not at the system level. If you are using `sudo` to install gems, then "you're doing it wrong".
    - If you're on a Mac, you should use the Homebrew package manager: http://brew.sh. On linux your system will already have a package manager.
  - Rails, latest version 4.1

#Assignment:
Once you have followed the instructions for your operating system, paste the output of `which ruby` ,  `gem env`, and `which rails` into the assignment submission online
