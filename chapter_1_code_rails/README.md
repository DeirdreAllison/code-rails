###As a developer, I want to understand automated testing so that I can use BDD

**How do we know our app works?**

  You can test manually, with teams of real people, or you can automate it. Or both!

####Types of Testing
**Unit Tests**

Unit testing tests "the smallest testable part of an application". This could be an object-oriented class, or even an individual function (or method). Unit tests are fast because they test only one thing at a time. Each test case should be independent of the others. They help find problems early, make it easy to change both the unit under test, and other parts of your program that depend on your unit. They can help simplify system-wide integration testing. Unit tests provide "documentation as code". Not as good as real documentation, but it has its advantages because unit tests that are out of date will fail. Unit tests drive design by specifying "the ends" and not "the means". Disadvantages of unit testing are that because it is so specific, it can't catch more complex errors that rely on multiple units. For example, complex states of multiple objects, or problems with multiple threads. In Rails, we typically use unit testing for Models, and you can find the unit tests in the spec/models directory.

Please Read [this Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) about unit testing

**Functional Tests**

Please read [this article](http://www.softwaretestingtricks.com/2007/01/unit-testing-versus-functional-tests.htm) about the difference between functional and unit testing (THIS LINK IS BROKEN)

**Integration Tests**

> "integration tests show that the major parts of a system work well together"

-[The Pragmatic Programmer](http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer), a recommended book

**Acceptance Tests**

Complete User stories with as close to real life data as possible

**Regression Tests**

Tests that ensure bugs are not produced after changes to apparently-unrelated code are made. Also, tests that are put in place to ensure that bugs do not re-appear.

####Types of development
**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

>"Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. Kent Beck, who is credited with having developed or 'rediscovered' the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence"

[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development )

**Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**
>"In software engineering, behavior-driven development (abbreviated BDD) is a software development process based on test-driven development (TDD). Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software developers and business analysts with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development, with the aim of delivering software that matters (as opposed to software that doesn't matter).

####In this workbook, when we say "BDD a ________" We mean:

- **Red**: Write a spec and watch it fail. For the first few days, we'll provide the specs to get you going
- **Green**: Research / Learn the part of Rails you need and write the code to make the spec pass
- **Refactor**: Analyze the code quality and refactor it if time available.

###As a developer, I want to use and understand BDD so that my projects turn out great

####As a dev, I want a simple program that has a welcome message, so that I learn how to write and test a simple ruby project

Use BDD with MiniSpec to create a ruby class that has an instance variable containing a welcome message

**Read and do**

[How to Set Up Your First Minispec Project, From Scratch](https://gist.github.com/ivanoats/6833823)

**Example specification:**
``` ruby
require "minitest/autorun"
require "minitest/spec"
require "welcome"

describe Welcome do
  it "has a message" do
    hello = Welcome.new
    hello.message.must_match "Welcome"
  end
end
```
[MiniSpec Quick Reference](http://mattsears.com/articles/2011/12/10/minitest-quick-reference)

####As a dev, I want a program to test a web search, so that I can learn more about interacting with web pages

Add a Gemfile to the project you started in the last step to manage the gems on which it depends. Include the rake gem to get started.

```ruby
# ~myapp/Gemfile

source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "rake"
```

Read the [Capybara Readme](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara). Don't worry if it doesn't all make sense yet

Add Capybara as a gem dependency for your project. Modify your Gemfile to include:
```ruby
# ~myapp/Gemfile

gem "capybara"
```
Read the [Poltergeist docs](https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist) and then add to Gemfile:
```ruby
# ~myapp/Gemfile

gem "poltergeist"
```

Then be sure to run `bundle install` from your project directory to install all gems.

**Example specification for a google search, please use your own search term:**
```ruby
# ~/myapp/spec/search_spec.rb

require "spec_helper"

describe "My search page" do
  it "has results" do
    visit "http://google.com"
    fill_in "q", with: "Code Fellows"
    click_on "Google Search"
    page.text.must_include "codefellows.org"
    page.text.must_include "twitter.com/CodeFellowsOrg"
  end
end
  ```

**Example spec_helper.rb:**
```ruby
# ~/myapp/spec/spec_helper.rb

require "minitest/autorun
require "minitest/spec"

class FeatureSpec < MiniTest::Spec
  require "capybara/poltergeist"
  include Capybara::DSL
  Capybara.default_driver = :poltergeist
  register_spec_type(/page$/, self)
end
```
Important reminder: This spec_helper.rb file sets up Capybara to work for any feature specs you create that have a description ending in "...page".

####As a dev, I want a web page that outputs a welcome message via HTML, so that I can learn how to test web pages
Use BDD to develop a simple HTML page. You can create an html page with your text editor.

If you create a file called `index.html`, you can see it in your browser by putting the full file path in your browser's address bar. On a Mac, from the same directory as the file, you can type `open index.html`

Alternatively, get any directory's files online locally with a tiny ruby script:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

#
# example:
#  serve public 4001
#
# Spin up a quick web server for files in the specified directory (first arg)
# on the port number given (second arg).
#

require "webrick"

s = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new
  :DocumentRoot => (ARGV[0] || Dir.pwd),
  :Port => (ARGV[1] || 4000)
  )

trap('INT') { s.shutdown }

s.start
```

**OR** you can create a serve function in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile (in your home directory:

```bash
function serve {
            port="${1:-4000}"
            ruby -r webrick -e "s = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(:Port => $port, :DocumentRoot => Dir.pwd); trap('INT') { s.shutdown }; s.start"
          }
  ```

  *important:* the commands inside the string (inside the double quotes) must all be on *one* line

**OR** you can create a serve.sh file, and make it executable. Example [here](https://gist.github.com/ivanoats/6613386)

**Example specification:**

```ruby
# ~/myapp/spec/features/welcome_page_spec.rb

require "spec_helper"

describe "A local web page" do
  it "has a welcome headline" do
    visit "/something/goes/here/..."
    page.text.must_include "Welcome aboard"
  end
end
```
####As a dev, I want a basic Rails app up and running on port 3000 of my computer

BDD `rails new sample-app`. Write your test first! What would a test that looks on port 3000 look like?

Be careful where you run this command. Be sure to make this new app outside of your current project directory tree. You don't need to submit this new rails app with your main project code.

Once you've created the Rails app, how can you start it up?

Need a hint? Try changing in to the directory for the new Rails project you just created, and type just `rails`.

**Example specification:**
```ruby
# ~/myapp/spec/features/rails_new_spec.rb

require "spec_helper"

describe "My Rails App welcome page" do
  it "shows the welcome message" do
    visit "http://localhost:3000"
    page.text.must_include "Welcome aboard"
  end
end
```

####As a Rails developer, I want to understand the structure of a Rails app so that I can understand Rails conventions

WTF just happened when I typed "rails new …" ???

You have a fresh new Rails app, which by default says "Welcome Aboard"

Read Section 3.2 only from the ["Getting Started" Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-the-blog-application)

**What is Rails?**

- a Ruby framework

  >"Rails is actually a collection of 7 different ruby gems that are designed to function independently or together, to form a framework for web apps."
- Utilizes Convention over Configuration
  - [More about convention over configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)
  - [Optional bonus Reading](http://softwareengineering.vazexqi.com/files/pattern.html)
- open source, built around community best practices
- Remember our slides:
  - Web app vs Web site
  - Can persist user data in a database
