###Use experiential teaching techniques to make learning easier & faster

#####David Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle and Learning Styles
"David Kolb identified four types activities in the adult education process that must all be performed to achieve true understanding: Concrete Experience -> Reflective Observation -> Abstract Conceptualization -> Active Experimentation. Each stage is mutually supportive of and feeds into the next. It is possible to enter the cycle at any stage and follow it through around the circle."

#####Kathy Sierra's Badass User Talk and Edge Practice
- Practice Makes Permanent
- If you could do one thing to make your users more badass, provide them with repeated exposure to the performance, process, and results of badass users. (models)
- Edge Practice: a progressive series of exercises, each designed to build a fine-grained skill within 1 to 3 sessions.
- Edge / deliberate practice is NOT the same as tutorials. High-quality, low-latency feedback. Example: play this short musical passage with no mistakes, at this speed in this key.
