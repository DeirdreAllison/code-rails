# 0.1 Course Objectives

Welcome to Code Rails!

This workbook requires your active participation. This is not a reference manual, nor is it light weekend reading. You should not skip around (unless explicitly mentioned), and you should not take shortcuts (don't worry, we are showing you the short path already).

This book works under the assumption that you are highly motivated to learn professional-grade web development skills.

The Code Fellows Development Accelerator course as a whole has 3 main objectives:

- Give students new super powers
- Make learning easier & faster with science
- Guide you in building an app like a professional

Read about these in the next sections.
