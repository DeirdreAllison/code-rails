# 0.2 Our Values

###Best practices

Rails is a web app framework that is influenced by best practices at its very core.

>"A best practice is a method or technique that has consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other means, and that is used as a benchmark" - [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice)

Rails was originally an abstraction out of a web app, Basecamp. It was designed to take out the "boring parts" of web app creation, and to make new web apps "the right way".

###BDD

Behavior Driven Development outlines an application's expected features and functionality first, before the coding begins. As Dan North says "Behavior is a more useful word than test". Focusing on the behavior of an application reduces question of what to test, what to call the tests, and which things to test.

###Engaging communication.
We help people pay attention: "Activities are designed to fully engage the learning process. We encourage reflection, experimentation, play, communication and professional growth."

###Build upon fundamentals.
Break it in to pieces, put the pieces together.

###Paths and Sandboxes:
  "A path is a prescribed series of steps that get completed one after another. It's your classic tutorial. A sandbox is a collaborative learning space that values exploration, play, and generating autonomy.  While there are many paths to Rails learning online, it's harder to provide a great example of a sandbox. That is why we are gathered here together in person at this Code Fellows Bootcamp. It's why we don't focus on creating yet another path for you to follow. "

###The Honor Code:
As members of the Code Fellows community, each of us upholds and supports a high standard of personal, and community, honesty and integrity.  We believe these values are critical to a community dedicated to learning, personal development, and a search for understanding. We consider them essential in promoting personal responsibility, moral and intellectual leadership, and pride in ourselves and our organization.

Therefore, each of us agrees to represent ourselves truthfully, claim only work that is our own, properly attribute collaborations, and engage honestly in all assignments.  Moreover, each of us shares the responsibility for encouraging and reinforcing the importance of integrity in other community members.  Members of the Code Fellows community who misrepresent themselves or their work through cheating, fabrication, facilitation, plagiarism, etc, or who suspect another of such misrepresentation are expected to follow the Reporting Procedures outlined.  Code Fellows instructors and leaders reserve the right to remove any students or graduates who fail to live up to these standards from bootcamps, classes, or other parts of community membership, as appropriate.

Consistent with the basic expectations of the Honor Code, students who believe they may have violated Code Fellowsâ€™ standards of integrity are expected to acknowledge their concerns to the instructor in the class or to Code Fellows staff.  Moreover, a student who observes what may be any dishonest behavior on the part of another student is expected to share that concern with the student immediately. At that point, if either student believes that an Honor Code violation may have occurred, the student observed is expected to self-report the incident immediately to the instructor in the class or to his or her or administrative adviser. Self-reporting does not constitute an admission of guilt but is an essential step, necessary to prevent misunderstanding and apprehensions. Within three class days, the observer will also contact a member of Code Fellows management to insure that the self-report has indeed taken place.  The instructor will review the elements of the complaint, and if the instructor believes that the Honor Code has been violated, he or she will contact a member of Code Fellows management, who will take appropriate action."

###Diversity and Equality

Don't be a hater, we are all here in this together, and want to create a welcoming environment for everyone here. A Code Fellow works to widen access to computer science education and ensure it is open to all."

####Non-discrimination policy:
As a part of our honor code, in order to maintain personal and communal integrity, Code Fellows is committed to the principle that all persons shall have equal access to programs, facilities, services, and employment without regard to personal characteristics not related to ability, performance, or qualifications as determined by Code Fellows policy and/or applicable laws.

Code Fellows prohibits discrimination, harassment and bullying against any person because of age, ancestry, color, disability or handicap, national origin, race, religion, gender, sexual or affectional orientation, gender identity, appearance, matriculation, political affiliation, marital status, veteran status or any other characteristic protected by law.  Code Fellows expects that its students, employees, volunteers, members, and other constituents of Code Fellows, when and where ever those individuals are conducting Code Fellows business or participating in Code Fellows classes, events, or activities, shall maintain an environment free of discrimination, including harassment, bullying, or retaliation.
